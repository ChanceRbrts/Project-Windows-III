# Project-Windows-III
So this is a thing that happened.
Windows III is the third of my experiments with windows and moving them around. (and the first actually uploaded to Github)
In this game, you move your character around using either A and D or Left and Right, move your hitbox (the black thing inside your character) using Up and Down, and just try to make it through to the end of the song.
However, the game has a small grudge in you doing this, and wants you to hit as many as possible, by any means necessary.
